# CyberProjects
I am a highly motivated college student at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville (SIUE), maintaining a 3.51 GPA and majoring in Business Administration Cybersecurity. I have a strong foundation in Python, SQL, Linux, IT, and Cybersecurity, complemented by industry-recognized certifications including CompTIA Security+, Network+, Google Cybersecurity, and Excel Associate Certificate.

My technical skills are matched by my soft skillsâ€”teamwork, leadership, critical thinking, and effective communication. As project lead, I took the initiative to modernize a mock airspaces donation program for a college project, guiding my team from concept to execution. (View project details)

I thrive on finding creative and sustainable solutions to real-world security problems. My passion lies in protecting organizations from threats, risks, and vulnerabilities, while bringing a unique and open-minded perspective to every project. I enjoy collaborating with others, and I believe that the best security solutions are built through curiosity, communication, and teamwork.

Outside of technology, I am an avid fan of contact sports like wrestling, jiu-jitsu, and UFC. I also enjoy baking and working on cars, reflecting my hands-on approach and eagerness to learn new things.

Mission Statement:
I am seeking opportunities to learn, grow, and gain hands-on experience by obtaining an entry-level position or internship in cybersecurity. My goal is to apply my knowledge, develop practical skills, and make meaningful contributions through collaboration with professionals in the field.

What drives me:
The opportunity to solve real security challenges and continuously improve. I am a lifelong learner who is always striving to grow, adapt, and help build safer digital environments.
